# Spotify Clone Redux
In this project, I've taken on the challenge of refactoring a Spotify app, utilizing React and Redux for an enhanced state management experience.
The goal was to replicate key functionalities of the Spotify platform, such as liking a track and creating playlists, to offer a more dynamic and personalized user experience. To ensure a vast and up-to-date music library, I used Strive School's Deezer API to fetch song data.
